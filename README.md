- Periodically asks you what task you've been working on at customizable intervals
- Non-disruptive notifications that respect your focus time
- Simple prompts to describe your activities

### AI-Powered Summaries
- Uses an external Large Language Model (LLM) via Ollama for generating intelligent summaries
- Creates summaries based on your task descriptions and any references you provide
- Generates interval summaries for each time period
- Produces a comprehensive daily summary at the end of each session

### Session Management
- Tracks all tasks and summaries throughout your work session
- Consolidates interval summaries into a cohesive daily report
- Maintains a historical log of your activities

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Focus Management**: Regular check-ins help maintain awareness of time and task switching
- **Activity Logging**: Automatic documentation of what you've accomplished
- **Time Tracking**: Understand how you spend your time without manual effort
- **Progress Reporting**: Generate summaries for standups, status updates, or personal reflection
- **Neurodivergent Support**: Gentle, predictable structure that helps with task awareness

## 🚀 Getting Started

*(Installation and setup instructions will be added once the code is integrated)*

## 🤖 LLM Configuration

SheepCat uses an **external LLM setup** for generating intelligent summaries. The application is designed to work with **Ollama**, a local LLM runtime.

### Requirements
- Ollama installed and running on your system
- Your chosen LLM model downloaded via Ollama

### How It Works
- The application makes API calls to your local Ollama instance
- You can configure which model to use based on your preferences and hardware capabilities
- All LLM processing happens through the Ollama API endpoint

This external setup gives you:
- **Privacy**: Your data stays on your machine
- **Flexibility**: Choose any Ollama-compatible model
- **Control**: Run the LLM on your own hardware

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Start a Session**: Begin tracking your work day
2. **Interval Prompts**: Receive gentle notifications at set intervals asking what you're working on
3. **Task Description**: Provide a brief description and any relevant references
4. **AI Processing**: The LLM analyzes your input and generates a summary
5. **Interval Summaries**: Each time period gets its own summary
6. **Daily Summary**: At session end, all summaries are consolidated into a comprehensive daily report

## 🌈 Philosophy

SheepCat is built with neurodivergent users in mind, offering:
- **Gentle reminders** rather than intrusive notifications
- **Flexible intervals** that adapt to your workflow
- **Automated summarization** to reduce cognitive load
- **Friendly interface** that makes task tracking approachable
